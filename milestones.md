## Josh  
Last week: I worked on the proposal with the group, setup our stripe account. I also implemented CardScan.  
Due next meeting: create mockup designs for login/register and payment screen UI. Implement "loading money" from card onto account and then removing traces of card.


## Ryland Sepic 

Last week: as a group we wrote and submitted our proposal, and I also worked on 
the milestone video as well as a design doc for Git.

Next week: I will be working on the transfer from account to account, making sure 
it is secure, and that the necessary information is in place to follow through with 
the transaction. 

Stuck on: Will we run into any trouble storing money? Can we use Stripe to put money 
onto a prepaid debit card?

## DJ 

Last week: learned the basic rules of Firebase and iOS segue and build a template with register and login function through Firebase
Next week: Improve register and login function as well as learning how to interact Firebase with Stripe.

## LIUSIYU 

I learned the basic concept of Stripe, and tried to apply Stripe into DJâ€™s template after the registration, which is a screen with a pay button, but I had a trouble in connecting my viewcontroller with the pay button. Hope I could solve it in the next week.
